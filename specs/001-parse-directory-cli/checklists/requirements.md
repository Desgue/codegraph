# Specification Quality Checklist: Parse Directory CLI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

All validation items passed successfully:

- **Content Quality**: Specification is free of implementation details (no mentions of specific CLI libraries, Go packages in requirements). Focused on user needs (parsing directories with flexible input). Written accessibly for stakeholders.

- **Requirement Completeness**:
  - No clarification markers needed - all requirements are clear
  - All 9 functional requirements are testable
  - Success criteria use measurable metrics (100%, <100ms)
  - Success criteria avoid technology details
  - Acceptance scenarios defined for both user stories
  - 5 edge cases identified
  - Scope bounded by "Out of Scope" section
  - Dependencies and assumptions documented

- **Feature Readiness**:
  - Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
  - User scenarios cover parse-with-argument and parse-without-argument flows
  - Success criteria align with functional requirements
  - No implementation leakage detected

**Status**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.
