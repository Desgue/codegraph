# Specification Quality Checklist: Go Source Parser

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: core parsing, P2: module awareness, P3: documentation)
- Comprehensive edge cases covering various scenarios
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics (5 seconds for 50k LOC, 1000 files)
- Well-defined entities for the parsing domain
- Clear scope boundaries with explicit "Out of Scope" section
